# workDayScheduler# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.This application will help people with busy schedules who want to add important events to a daily planner, so that they can manage thier time effectively. This app is expected to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.





## Functionality

```
When the user opens the planner
the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
when scrolling down the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours
each time block is color-coded gray to indicate it is in the past, red for the present, and green for the future.
users can click into a time block to enter an event and click the save button for that time block to save a task.
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
when the page is refreshed the saved events persist
```
